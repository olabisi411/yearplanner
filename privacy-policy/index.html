    <p class="date">Effective Date: December 31, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Brandnosis</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in the <strong>Year Planner</strong> mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>

    <p><strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> To provide and maintain the service, including the display of advertisements, certain information is collected automatically by third-party services.</p>

    <h2>2. Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App includes third-party advertising services (such as Google AdMob) to remain free to use. These third-party providers may collect and use certain data to show ads that are relevant to you. This data may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP Address</li>
        <li>Advertising ID (AAID on Android)</li>
        <li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
        <li>Interaction data with ads shown in the App</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the policy of our primary ad provider:</p>
    <p><strong>Google AdMob & AdSense:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may require the following permissions:</p>

        <li><strong>Access Network State:</strong> To check if a connection is available for ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising ID Permission:</strong> To provide personalized advertising.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Choices (Opt-Out)</h2>
    <p>You can reset your advertising identifier or opt-out of personalized ads through your Android device settings:</p>
    <p><em>Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization (or "Delete Advertising ID").</em></p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your planning data is managed locally. Uninstalling the app will delete all local data. Data collected by advertising partners is subject to their respective retention policies.</p>
